CallForPapers
========================

This project is a simple way of creating and maintaining papers for conferences for both speakers and conference organizers. 
It will allow conference organisers to open a call-for-papers. Speakers will directly see which conferences are open, and 
where to submit to. When the CFP is open, speakers can easily automatically add their profile and talks to the conference.

When the CFP is closed, the conference-hosts (can be multiple users), can vote / discuss the papers, and select the papers 
that will be added to the conference. It will be able to automatically send acceptance/rejections emails if needed.

It is basically complements the joind.in project which can be found at https://github.com/joindin/joind.in.

There is still a long todo list, see documentation/TODO for more information.

The project is based on the Symfony2 framework.
